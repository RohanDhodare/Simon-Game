# Simon-Game
A website is developed where you can play traditional Simon Game in which you have to remember a pattern of the buttons played and then click them in the same order to clear the level. 
There are unlimited Levels in the game, with each level the number of buttons increases by one.
I have used HTML and CSS for the front-end development of webiste and the game logic was implemented using JavaScript and jQuery.
